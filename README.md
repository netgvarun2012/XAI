# XAI
XAI/MLI solution for Kaggle use case using Python.

 Machine learning solutions have traditionally been backboxes. ​

​ Important to have accountability of such algorithms since in some cases they can be used to make potentially life-changing decisions. ​

​ In this project, we have explored the domain of Crowdfunding of projects, specifically "why not every project is able to completely reach their target goal of raising capital". ​

​ We have used machine learning explainability techniques to answer the key questions related to the success (or failure) of any crowdfunding project.​

​ Dataset is collected from Kaggle.​
